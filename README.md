# CAREER-EXPLORATION-CHATBOT
The project involves creating a career exploration chatbot using Python's Flask web framework. It provides users with career guidance based on their interests and skills by utilizing SQLite for user authentication and data storage. The chatbot employs NLP techniques with NLTK for understanding user queries and a Keras deep learning model for intent classification. The application is hosted locally, allowing users to register, log in, and interact with the chatbot through a web browser for a seamless career exploration experience.
